          I’m voting for Kamala Harris because I have seen her in action.<br />
          She commands respect in a room. She speaks with passionate conviction.
          She knows what’s she’s doing. She is honest, she is smart and she has that special intangible “something” that
          is the
          ingredient for greatness.<br />
          She is our best choice.<br />
          She is our ONLY choice.<br />

          I was honored to hear Vice President Harris speak when she visited Utah this summer. I particularly loved her
          positive
          approach when she talked about what our country can be in the future. She gave me renewed hope in the promise
          of America
          and inspired me to work even harder to save our democracy. Vice President Harris and Governor Walz are the
          ethical,
          smart, and well-qualified leaders that our country needs and deserves. We all have an opportunity to help
          shape the future
          of our nation and world by doing everything we can to make sure they are elected.

          I believe that Kamala Harris is the change needed to address, course
          correct, lead, guide, DIRECT, and to create political, economic, and
          social power for the collective whole. To enact policies that will
          improve the lives of all people.
          To be responsible for addressing challenges in our communities, related
          to health disparities and civil rights.
          …and to all who are gathered with us in this space, for such a time as
          this, I am, Emma E Houston, and of course, I am financially supporting
          and voting for Kamala Harris.
          Thank you for this opportunity to actively participate in this
          movement to elect Kamala Harris as President and Tim Walz as Vice
          President, as the leaders of these United States of America.

          This election, I am voting FOR a multi-talented, inspirational and democracy-saving candidate.<br />
          In the late 50s when I was in Elementary school….Every day as we prepared to go outside for recess ….the
          captains for
          the boys baseball team….pick their team members…..I was always the ONLY girl picked…I was a fast runner and
          could hit
          the ball….These boys were my FRIENDS and I knew I was as good as they were…
          BUT AFTER school, we rode our bikes from school to the nearby boys Little League Baseball Park….There, I
          vividly
          recall
          watching through the chain link fence, my fingers clutching the wires, as I watched these very boys that I
          competed with
          DURING RECESS, but where now I was required to be a spectator.
          Well, it’s a different time now, people….
          Our team is the United States of America. Tim Walz is our ACE catcher! And,
          I’m voting for Kamala Harris because she’s not only able to be on the team, SHE’S OUR ACE PITCHER! (1) She’s a
          finisher,
          (2) she knows how to throw curve balls, and (3) she can pick off the runner who intends to steal a base.

          I'm voting for Vice President Kamala Harris for President because she embodies the transformative change our
          country
          needs. Her strong commitment to reproductive rights, economic justice, and environmental sustainability sets
          her apart
          as a leader who fights for all Americans. With Governor Tim Walz as her running mate, they offer a unified
          vision for
          tackling critical issues while representing the hard-working American people. This election will shape our
          future for
          decades, so let’s support Harris and Walz to ensure a more inclusive and progressive America. Join me in

            As a Daughter of Utah, a refugee from Vietnam, I have not felt so excited like this for a
            long time. I am so excited to be supporting Kamala Harris for the next president of the
            United States and Tim Walz, as the next Vice President of our country.
            Thank you, Kamala and Tim, for bringing back the ethics, the joy and the pride to be an American, to be a
            woman and a daughter of refugees.

            [REAR ADMIRAL HUAN NUGYEN shared thoughts in Vietnamese, a portion is translated below]<br />
            I am Rear Admiral Huan Nguyen, US Navy, Retired. I send my warmest regards to the
            Vietnamese American voters.
            For over 50 years, I have considered myself the luckiest person in the world. I have
            lived in a society where the constitution of our nation is by the people, for the people,
            and of the people. Our country has been governed by Presidents whom we have
            chosen.
            As citizens of this free country, we must exercise our right to vote to continue upholding
            democracy and protecting our rights. Therefore, I fully support the ticket of Vice
            President Kamala Harris and Governor Tim Walz, as they embody the values of
            democracy, freedom, and rights that resonate with the culture of our Vietnamese
            American community.

          I find Kamala Harris's diverse background and progressive policies inspiring. As a minority woman who owns a
          business
          and runs a nonprofit organization, I deeply value her commitment to social justice and equity. As the first
          female Vice
          President and the first woman of South Asian and African American descent to run for the highest political
          position, she
          offers a unique perspective on leadership. Her speech at the DNC 2024 exemplifies her dedication to equity,
          inclusion,
          and progressive change. </div>

          Why I Support Kamala Harris for President: An Indigenous Perspective
          As a member of the Diné (Navajo) Nation, I firmly support Kamala Harris for President. She embodies the Diné
          values of
          protecting our communities, lands, and future. Harris understands the systemic injustices Native communities
          face and is
          committed to meaningful relationships with Tribal Nations, honoring our sovereignty and history.
          She has pledged to honor tribal sovereignty and invest in Native American communities across the U.S.,
          ensuring that
          Tribes have a voice. Her commitment reminds me of my Diné principle of Hózhó, emphasizing harmony and balance,
          she
          reassures me that she will advocate for the protection of public lands and action on climate change—issues
          vital to
          Indigenous communities.
          Kamala Harris envisions a United States where all voices, including Indigenous, are respected.
          Supporting her means endorsing a future where our children can thrive, with their rights safeguarded, cultures
          celebrated, and lands preserved.

          Let’s do our part—vote, donate, volunteer!

          I’m for Kamala Harris because, as important as Kamala’s policies for economic and social change are, the most
          important
          thing for me is her integrity and morality. Integrity and morality in our leaders are the foundation of good
          government.
          Kamala Harris would bring that strong foundation as president, but Donald Trump would not. I am also for
          Kamala Harris
          because of the joy, optimism, and vision for the future that she brings. Those qualities are so refreshing and
          invigorating after the dark, negative threats and warnings that form the basis of Donald Trump’s campaign.

          A vote for Vice President Harris as president is a strong choice for a more representative and responsive
          democracy.
          With her extensive experience as Vice President, senator, and former prosecutor, Harris has consistently
          worked to
          address the needs of all Americans, regardless of status and identity.

          Living in a democracy is a privilege, and on November 6th, I want to know I’ve done everything to elect Kamala
          Harris as
          our next President. My children deserve a country where every person can thrive, and I believe Kamala Harris
          is the
          leader who will make that possible. She embodies leadership, putting others first and upholding the law, even
          when no
          one is watching. She will work to create an America that protects individual rights and bridges divides across
          party
